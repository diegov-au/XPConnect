#XP Connect

XPConnect is designed as an FSUIPC emulator to primarily interface between XPLANE 11 and Sim-Avionics.

Installation: Install the win.xpl plugin file in X-Plane 11\Resources\plugins\XPConnect. A wideclient emulator is available as XPConnectClient.exe. Ensure you modify the XPConnectClient.ini file to point to the X-Plane "server".
