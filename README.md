#XP Connect

XPConnect is designed as an FSUIPC emulator to primarily interface between XPLANE 11 and Sim-Avionics. It is based on the XConnect project by Bart Devriendt and Mat Sutcliffe maintained here http://xplaneconnect.sourceforge.net/.

XPConnect features improved performance, tailored offsets for Sim-Avionics and a functional wide client. The software may be buggy and milage may vary.

Installation: Install the win.xpl plugin file in X-Plane 11\Resources\plugins\XPConnect. A wideclient emulator is available as XPConnectClient.exe. Ensure you modify the XPConnectClient.ini file to point to the X-Plane "server".
